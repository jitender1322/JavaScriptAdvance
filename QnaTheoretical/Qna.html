        <h2>1. Can you provide a brief overview of the history of JavaScript and its significance in web development?
        </h2>
        <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262
            standard in
            1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript
            for the
            Firefox browser.</p>

        <h2>2. What are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>The fundamentals of JavaScript are the building blocks of the language. These include variables, data types,
            control
            structures, functions, and objects. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for anyone looking to become
            proficient
            in JavaScript programming.</p>
        <hr>


        <h2>3. Explain the basic syntax of JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>
            The syntax of JavaScript is similar to other programming languages such as C and Java. It uses keywords,
            variables, and
            functions to create statements and expressions. A statement is a line of code that performs a specific
            action, and an
            expression is a line of code that evaluates to a value.
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>4. How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages?</h2>
        <p>Most programming languages are compiled, meaning that the code must be compiled into machine code before it
            can be run.
            On the other hand, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be compiled
            before it can be
            run.</p>
        <hr>


        <h2>5. What are the best practices to write clean and efficient JavaScript code?</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use consistent style</li>
            <li>Follow naming conventions</li>
            <li>Avoid global variables</li>
            <li>Modularize your code</li>
            <li>Apply design patterns</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>6. What are the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript for declaring variables?</h2>
        <p>A thorough comprehension of let, var, and const is crucial for writing clean and predictable JavaScript code.
            While let
            offers block-level scoping, var, an older construct, provides function-level scoping. On the other hand,
            const declares
            variables meant to remain constant throughout the program.</p>
